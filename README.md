# PacMen

## Description

This project was done in order to practice influencing the DOM with JavaScript and create moving objects on a screen.

Take a look at the demo on my portfolio page [here](https://lukas-dh.github.io/05_pacmen/index.html).

## Installation

You can run this application in your broswer by simply downloading the files in one folder and opening the index.html  

## Future improvements

I am thinking of adding some obstacles for the Pacmen to bounce off.
